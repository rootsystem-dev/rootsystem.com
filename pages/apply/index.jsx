            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              We're also a venture firm with a portfolio of early stage startups (twelve and counting!), some of whom are looking to hire someone like you.

            <ListItem>
              We're building a structured program for people like you to learn how to level-up and become true engineering leaders.
