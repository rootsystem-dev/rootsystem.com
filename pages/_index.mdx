# Root System

Root System is a new kind of consulting firm.

We are a group of veteran founders, CTOs, developers, and product designers, and we work at steeply discounted rates in exchange for stock in the companies we serve.  This means we are incentivized to do a *very* good job.

We help startup founders de-risk their product/technology by designing & building high-quality software and high-functioning engineering organizations.   We also help those founders raise capital and recruit full-time staff to replace us before we move on.

You can think of Root System as a seed stage venture firm, but one that invests sweat and brainpower and code (which are highly differentiated) instead of investing cash (which is not);  or if you prefer, think of us as an accelerator for your product itself.
